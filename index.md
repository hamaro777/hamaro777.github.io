## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/boys.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="10" width="40%" align="right"/>
After two mentally challenging? years of studying at the Physics Department at the University of Turku, I managed to change my life around with support from my family and friends and applied to University of Helsinki to study linguistics as my major. Now as I have completed half of my first year with passion towards my field, the excitement and blah is difficult to put into words.

I applied to my department with headstrong goals to become a researcher but now as I have scraped the surface of language technology, I would also like to see the depths. Thought of realistic employment is also tempting me towards more practical thinking.
