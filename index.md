## Introduction

After two years of testing my mental limits and studying at the Physics Department at the University of Turku, I managed to completely turn my goals and interests on their head and successfully applied to University of Helsinki to study linguistics as my major. Now after completing half of my first year in a field with a completely different approach to science I'm waiting to see just what I can make out of myself.


I applied to my department with headstrong goals of becoming a researcher but now as I have scraped the surface of language technology, I would also like to see the depths. Thought of realistic employment possibilities is also tempting me towards changing my previous plans.
